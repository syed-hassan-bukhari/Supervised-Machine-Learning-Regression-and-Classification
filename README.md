🚀 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification




📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my complete hands-on implementations of the first two courses from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization.

All major algorithms are implemented from scratch to deeply understand:

the math

the intuition

the optimization process

Rather than relying on high-level libraries, the focus is on core machine learning principles.
